# zTurbo
A parallel programmed powershell script to setup a clean windows install as fast as possible

## Features

- This script is a small part of [zoicware](https://github.com/zoicware/ZOICWARE) that includes Registry Tweaks, Group Policy Tweaks, Debloat, and Disable Services.
- Each tweak is ran on a different core using powershell jobs in order to complete the optimization much faster than running in serial
